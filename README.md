# Motivational-code-extension


Sometime while working tirelessly I feel demotivated , so to motivate myself I have created this extension

By default, when you open a new tab in Chrome, you are presented with a blank page or a generic page displaying commonly visited websites or a search bar. This can be monotonous and may not provide any visual stimulation or motivation.

The solution I'd like.
I want something which can motivate me instantly without ao much searching or surfing as in this high pace world it is very difficult to keep ourself motivated

Alternatives I've considered.
The extension solves the problem of a dull and uninspiring new tab page experience in the Chrome browser.
The extension addresses this problem by replacing the default new tab page with a visually engaging background image of nature and displaying motivational quotes. This helps to create a more pleasant and inspiring environment for users when they open a new tab.
